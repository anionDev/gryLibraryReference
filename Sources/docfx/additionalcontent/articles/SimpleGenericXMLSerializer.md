# SimpleGenericXMLSerializer

`SimpleGenericXMLSerializer` is a generic XML-Serializer which is simply a wrapper for [XmlSerializer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.xml.serialization.xmlserializer). With `SimpleGenericXMLSerializer` you can serialize all of the objects which are also serializable by the original `XmlSerializer` from Microsoft. So why would anyone use `SimpleGenericXMLSerializer`? Because it is a one-line-wrapper for the `object`-to-`string`- and `string`-to-`object`-operation where you do not really have to do anything more. It is only another layer of simplification on top of the `XmlSerializer`. `SimpleGenericXMLSerializer` also allows to set custom [XmlWriterSettings](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.xml.xmlwritersettings).
