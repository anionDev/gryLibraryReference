You can generate the entire class-reference and documentation offline on your own PC. To get this work you must prepare some things:

* You must have cloned the GRYLibrary-repository beside the GRYLibraryReference-repository. Example: If this repository is located that `C:\Dev\projects\gryLibraryReference` then this scripts are expecting to find the GRYLibrary-repository in `C:\Dev\projects\gryLibrary`.
* OpenCover.Console must be available as commandline-command
* ReportGenerator.Console must be available as commandline-command
* Do not have uncommitted changed in `C:\Dev\projects\gryLibrary`. The scripts may change the current branch of this repository.

**Caution!** This scripts come with absolutely no warranty.
